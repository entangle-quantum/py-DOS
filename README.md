# Py-DOS
an attempt at the recreation of Microsoft's MS-DOS in Python, written by @CherryDev-Arch on her alt because she can't access her main GitHub at school. 

# What is Py-DOS?
As stated before, it is an attempt at remaking the Microsoft Disk Operating System (MS-DOS).

# Will it become a full remake of MS-DOS?
Nope, this is purely a desktop program that simulates what MS-DOS was like. I'd rather not get into legal trouble with Microsoft because I will NOT win.
